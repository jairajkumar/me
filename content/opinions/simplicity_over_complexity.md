Here's an opinion that might be controversial: **the best code is the code you didn't write**.

## The Complexity Trap

We engineers love building things. We love elegant abstractions, clever patterns, and sophisticated architectures. But sometimes, in our pursuit of the "perfect" solution, we create systems that are:

- Hard to understand
- Difficult to debug
- Expensive to maintain
- Slow to modify

## Simple > Clever

I've learned that a straightforward, "boring" solution that everyone on the team can understand is almost always better than a clever one that only its author can maintain.

> "Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it." — Brian Kernighan

## My Rule of Thumb

Before adding complexity, I ask myself:
1. Will this still make sense in 6 months?
2. Can a new team member understand this quickly?
3. Does the added complexity solve a real, current problem?

If the answer to any of these is "no," I simplify.
