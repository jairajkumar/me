Let’s be real for a second. For years, the "value flagship" space was Android’s fortress. If you wanted top-tier specs without selling a kidney, you bought a OnePlus, an iQOO, or a Xiaomi. But lately? I feel like Android manufacturers are intentionally shooting themselves in the foot.

I watched a recent video by **GeekyRanjit** that perfectly articulated something I’ve been feeling for months: **Android pricing in India has lost its mind.**

<!-- {{< youtube J2wo5xDzgS0 >}} -->

### The "Value" Myth

We are seeing new launches like the OnePlus 15 and iQOO 15 hitting the market at around **₹73,000**. Let that sink in. These are supposed to be the "affordable" alternatives to the ultra-premium tier.

What’s worse is the massive price gap—sometimes nearly ₹20,000—between the Chinese and Indian pricing for the exact same device. We used to justify this with import duties and taxes, but at this scale? It feels like we are just being taken for a ride.

### The iPhone 17 Curveball

While Android OEMs were busy inflating their prices, Apple did something they almost never do: **they made the base iPhone practically perfect.**

For the longest time, I couldn't recommend a non-Pro iPhone. They had 60Hz screens (in 2024!), slow charging, and measly 128GB base storage. But the new **iPhone 17** has flipped the script:

* **120Hz ProMotion?** Finally here.
* **Base Storage?** Bumped to 256GB.
* **Screen Quality?** Identical to the Pro models (3000 nits brightness).

Suddenly, the "Android advantage" of better specs for the price has evaporated. If you are sitting with a budget of ₹75,000, why would you buy a "value" Android that might get a green line issue in two years when you can get a fully loaded iPhone that will easily last you four or five?

### The Longevity Problem

This is the nail in the coffin for me. My friends with Android flagships often find themselves upgrading every 2–3 years because of battery degradation, buggy updates, or hardware failures. Meanwhile, an iPhone 12 Pro user is still cruising along comfortably.

When you do the math, buying one ₹80,000 iPhone every 5 years is cheaper than buying two ₹70,000 Androids in the same period.

### Conclusion

It hurts to say this as an Android enthusiast, but the manufacturers have become arrogant. They are stripping down camera features on standard models (likely to push you to the "Pro" or "Ultra" variants) while stuffing the software with bloatware.

Unless Android OEMs wake up and fix their pricing strategy, they are handing their market share to Apple on a silver platter. For the first time in years, the most logical recommendation for a regular user isn't a flagship killer—it's just the iPhone.
